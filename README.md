# Distributed-Systems-Project-Searching-Contents-in-a-Distributed-Application-Layer-Network

Implementation of a simple overlay-based solution that allows a set of nodes to share contents (e.g., music files) among each other. Consider a set of nodes connected via some overlay topology. Each of the nodes has a set of files that it is willing to share with other nodes. A node in the system (X) that is looking for a particular file issues a query to identify a node (Y) containing that particular file. Once the node is identified, the file can be exchanged between X and Y.
